It has a clean and modern syntax, offers seamless access to existing C and Objective-C code and frameworks, and is memory safe by default.Although inspired by Objective-C and many other languages, Swift is not itself a C-derived language. As a complete and independent language, Swift packages core features like flow control, data structures, and functions, with high-level constructs like objects, protocols, closures, and generics. Swift embraces modules, eliminating the need for headers and the code duplication they entail."
